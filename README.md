# Olympic Games Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Olympic Games data to explore patterns, trends, and relationships between various factors such as government investments in sports and medal counts. By leveraging Python and its data analysis libraries, the project aims to provide insights into how countries perform in the Olympics based on their socio-economic factors and investments in sports. The present analysis comes from poor Portugal performance in the Olympic Games. I want to understand and compare Nations to observe any signific points. I come to the conclusion that despite Countries having different number of habitants, an increase in expenditure in Sports will increase it's results/performance

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Handling missing values, filtering, and restructuring the dataset for analysis.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Exploring distributions of numerical variables like age, weight, and height of athletes.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Conducting t-tests to identify significant differences (e.g., comparing male and female athletesâ€™ heights or weights).
- **Medal Analysis**: Filtering data to explore relationships between medals won and other variables like investment.
- **Investment Analysis**: Comparing government expenditures on recreational sporting services with medal counts to assess correlations.
- **Exporting Results**: Saving insights into Excel files for sharing and further use.
